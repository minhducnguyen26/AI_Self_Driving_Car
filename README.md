This project involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a simplified self-driving car environment. The self-driving car will navigate through a simulated environment, avoiding obstacles, and following traffic rules using AI algorithms.

The AI algorithms used in this project can vary depending on the approach taken. One approach could be to use a neural network-based algorithm that takes in sensory data from the car's cameras and sensors and outputs the appropriate steering, braking, and accelerating commands. Another approach could be to use a rule-based system that encodes a set of rules for the car to follow, such as stopping at stop signs and traffic lights, giving way to other vehicles, and avoiding collisions.

This project provides an opportunity to explore the challenges and opportunities of developing self-driving car technology. By working with a simplified environment, it allows for a more manageable development process while still allowing for the exploration of key AI techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, and rule-based systems.
